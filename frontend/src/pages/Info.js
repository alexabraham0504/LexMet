                    The lawyer's fees are determined in accordance with the provisions of the Lawyer Profession Statute.

                  <p>
                    In determining fees for legal entities, we consider, in addition to the principles presented below, the possibility of developing payment methods for fees in various aspects such as:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>fixed fee</li>

                  <p>
                    In determining fees for individuals, the law firm promotes, for the purpose of establishing fees, the principle of direct negotiation, which is based on the following criteria:
                  </p>

                    Insolvency is the situation in which a company is unable to pay its debts to various creditors â€“ suppliers, tax authorities, or banks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Law 85/2014 describes it as "a state of the debtor's assets characterized by the insufficiency of available funds to pay certain, liquid, and due debts."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Insolvency does not automatically mean bankruptcy; it can be opened for the purpose of reorganizing the company based on a plan that may lead to the recovery of the business and exit from insolvency. Only when the reorganization fails can bankruptcy be triggered.

                    The reorganization of a company means its recovery under the Insolvency Law.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The goal of insolvency is not to reach bankruptcy and close the company, but to help it recover according to an established plan. In practice, a general insolvency procedure will be opened with the intention of reorganizing the company based on a reorganization plan. According to the provisions of Article 5 point 54 of Law no. 85/2014, reorganization is "the procedure applied to the debtor in insolvency, a legal entity, for the repayment of its debts according to the debt repayment schedule."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The reorganization plan involves the drafting, approval, confirmation, implementation, and compliance with a plan that may provide for:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>operational and/or financial restructuring of the debtor;</li>
                    <li>corporate restructuring through changes in the capital structure;</li>
                    <li>limiting activity through partial or total liquidation of the debtor's assets;</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    For this procedure, the payment schedule of the claims is particularly important for participants.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Creditors must know what amounts they will receive from the claims they hold against the debtor's assets and when they will be paid in order to conduct their own economic analysis.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to point 53 of Article 5, the debt repayment schedule is defined as "the schedule for their payment mentioned in the reorganization plan. Only if this reorganization plan and the rescue of the company fail will the bankruptcy procedure be initiated.

                  <p>
                    Bankruptcy is the second stage of the insolvency procedure that applies to the debtor for the liquidation of its assets to cover liabilities, followed by the removal of the debtor from the register in which it is registered.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If it is found that there are no assets in the debtor's estate or that these are insufficient to cover administrative costs, a decision may be made to dissolve the company.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Through the decision to enter bankruptcy, the judge will pronounce the dissolution of the debtor, a legal entity, and will order:
                  </p>
